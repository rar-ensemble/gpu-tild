This sample is set up to reproduce data from Riggleman, Kumar, Fredrickson,
JCP V136 024903 (2012). Specifically, it should be similar to data in Figure
4a, B=0.05, with E \approx 2700. 

The density of the condensed phases in [b^-3] units (as opposed to [Rg^-3]
units in the paper) should be approximately 6.6 or so.
